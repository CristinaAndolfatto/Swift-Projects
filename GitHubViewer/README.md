## Topics covered
- GET API call in SwiftUI & Async image for the profile image :)
- MVC design pattern
- Github Docs REST API

## What I would like to add
- Some other infos like number of following (I do not have followers, so..)
- An horizontal list view of cards with my repos title and description
- In the future, would be nice also to add the airdrop functionality to quickly share my Github profile (could be this App like a "Coder Business Card"? :) )
